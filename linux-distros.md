#### Key reasons for recommending AlmaLinux:

- Binary Compatibility with RHEL®
  AlmaLinux is fully binary compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux® (RHEL). This means all RHEL-compatible software, tools, and libraries can run on AlmaLinux without modification. Labs that rely on software originally designed for RHEL will experience the same performance and compatibility, ensuring smooth operations.
- Ease of Transition from CentOS
  For labs previously using CentOS, AlmaLinux provides an easy migration path, retaining the familiarity and functionality of a RHEL-like ecosystem. This is particularly beneficial for institutions transitioning from CentOS Stream to a stable, production-ready OS.
- Endorsed in Microsoft Azure

  AlmaLinux has been officially named an endorsed Linux distribution in Microsoft Azure. This endorsement signifies its reliability, enterprise-level support, and seamless compatibility with cloud infrastructure. Labs utilizing Azure for cloud-based computing, research, or virtualized environments can integrate AlmaLinux effortlessly into their workflow.
- Cost Efficiency for Students
  AlmaLinux eliminates the need for students to go through the process of obtaining a RHEL developer subscription, which, although free, can add unnecessary steps and restrictions. AlmaLinux is entirely free, making it an accessible choice for educational institutions and students alike.
